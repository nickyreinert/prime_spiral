# Prime Spiral 
Prime Spiral puts (prime) numbers on a spiral and marks prime number with a circle. 

This is inspired by the idea of the **[Ulam spiral](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulam-Spirale)**. The **Ulam spiral** shows some kind of geometrical symmetry for prime numbers. 

## Controls

- click "hide" to hide the parameters and enjoy the animation

- delay: how many milliseconds between each animation step, the higher, the slower the animation
- show numbers: check if you want to see all numbers
- show prime numbers: check if you want to see prime numbers only
- Prime arc outline color: the outline color of the prime number circles
- Prime arc fill color: the fill color of the prime number circles
- General outline color: the outline color of the spiral
- General fill color: the fill color of the spiral
- Resolution scale: the resolution of the visualisation, increase this value for better image quality
- Range: the range of the numbers to calculate
- Density: controls the resolion of the spiral's line, if you increase this value, the arc contains less points and gets "edgier"
- Rotation: the rotation of the whole spiral
- Slope: controls the distance from the center
- Intercept: controls the distance between each point
- Radius: the size of the prime number arcs

## Animation
- you can stop the animation by pressing "ESC" or deactivating the check box named "animate"
- you can animate the parameters range, density, rotation, slope, intercept and radius by clicking the checkbox right to the range slider elements
- the first text field contains the actual value, that also can be controlled by the range slider element
- the three text fields to the right of the range slider elements control the min, max and step values for each parameter
